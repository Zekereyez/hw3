### Programming Problem Notes
- Complile code using make or make all
- Run self made tests using the executable name and inputs
ie for llrec-tests you can use ./llrec-test llrec-test1.in llrec-test2.in
as llpivot will take the first argument and I have designed llfilter to take 
in the second argument with a longer testing list
- For stack.h testing use ./stack_test
- For heap and logicsim tests run using make in appropriate folders
